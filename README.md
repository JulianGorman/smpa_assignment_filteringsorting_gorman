# Assignment - Filtering & Sorting

Fork this repository so you have your own version under your Github account (rather than mine) to change and modify. Rename the repository to append your last name, e.g. `smpa_assignment_filteringsorting_kessler`.

Clone that new repository as a new project within RStudio/Posit Cloud.

Once that's done, open up the file `assignment1.R`, where you'll find the series of questions for this assignment. Please write in your code to return the required results, and include comments explaining what you've done for each answer.

As you move through working on the questions, make sure you "commit" at least three times along the way. You're welcome to do it more often should you choose, but ensure you've done at least three total commits.

When you're all done, ensure that you've committed and pushed all your changes to Github. Submit on Blackboard the web URL for your Github repo, as well as the URL for your Posit Cloud project.
